            <h6> October 17, 2018 - October 24, 2018 </h6> <!--adds a date to the section -->
            <p>Our goal of this project was to make an electrical winch system and a simulation of the system using the program, NetLogo. We wanted to make the electrical winch system that was able to carry the most weight with the most efficiency. We also wanted the simulation to show the effect of the drum size on linear speed, have a slider for voltage, and show the effect of voltage on speed. During the project, my main role was to created the winch simulation. I created the adjustable sliders for drum size, angular speed, voltage, and mass of the weight that the electrical winch would lift. I also wrote the code to make program respond to changes in the drum size and voltage. Throughout the duration of the project, I learned how to implement the code that we learned in class to make my visualization of the program come to real life, onto my screen. This was the most challenging part of the project, because there were times when my code would not follow my desired outcome. Sometimes, I felt like giving up because everything I tried would not work, but I persisted and eventually figured it out. This helped me learn how to be specific with my code because the smallest typo can make your whole program not work. The project also taught me how to work well with my team and manage our time. All of us split the work evenly and finished all the work before our deadline!  </p> <!--adds information to the section -->

            <h1>Project 2.3.2: West Point Bridge Designer, POE </h1> <!--makes a title for the section --> 
            <h6> March 8, 2019 - March 21, 2019 </h6> <!--adds a date to the section -->
            <p>Our goal of this project was to create a final bridge design under three hundred thousand dollars, using the West Point Bridge Designer software. We wanted to make a bridge that was able to withstand the weight of a truck, with the the least amount of tension and compression at each beam. My partner and I had to make two bridge ideas separately and then create a final design by modifying the best bridge. During the project, my main role was to make modifications to our brainstorm ideas to design a final bridge that was efficient and cost effective. To do this, I created a decision matrix, based on sturdiness, cost, aesthetics, and environmental impact,  which helped us pick a base, for our bridge. I made the chosen design have thicker and stronger beams, at the areas with the most compression and tension. I also reduced the size of the beams that were least affected by tension and compression in order to keep the cost low. All these modifications allowed us to create a bridge that was not only cheap and sturdy, but also aesthetically pleasing. During this project, I learned how to work effectively with my partner by combining both aspects of our individual bridges to make a better and stronger bridge. Throughout the duration of the project, I learned how to use the West Point Bridge Designer software to create a variety of bridges, with arch abutments, piers, and deck elevations. Coming up with the final design was the most challenging part of the project, because there were times when my bridge would be sturdy, but too expensive. Finding a perfect balance between bridge stability and the cost limit was time consuming, but luckily I planned my time effectively. The project taught me how useful it is to use simulations to envision how my ideas will work in the real world. </p> <!--adds information to the section -->

            <h6> November 6, 2019 - December 3, 2019 </h6> <!--adds a date to the section -->
            <p>The goal of this project was to create a Engineering Online Portfolio, using Repl.it and GitHub. The website needed to include an About Me page, Contact Me page, Projects page, Resume page, Work Experience page, and Home page. I wanted to have a website that showcased my talents and was consistent in format! During the project, I first started off by using my teacher's Online Portfolio as a guide for how mine should look. I used different resources (assignment sheet, Bootstrap website, and previous knowledge from Codecademy) to help me create the foundation for my website. After creating a base for my website, I started to fill out each page with information about myself. Towards the end of the project, we did a beta walk in class, where I was able to exchange feedback from my peers to make my website better. The feedback was extremely helpful and allowed me to make final adjustments to the mistakes that I did not notice beforehand. All these modifications allowed me to create a website that was easy to follow and valuable to display my experiences. Throughout the duration of the project, I learned how to use the Repl.it website in order to code my website. I also learned how to use GitHub in order to publish my website online, for others to view. I found it interesting how GitHub was able to do version control, which is a very valuable tool for website development. The most challenging part of the project was starting the code for the website, because there was no foundation to work off of and it was easy to make errors. Once I overcame this obstacle by using help from people around me and the Bootstrap website, I was able to complete the project successfully. The project taught me how useful it is to use resources around me, like online resources and peers, to put in my best effort!</p> <!--adds information to the section -->

            <h1>Photo Manipulation Project, CSP </h1> <!--makes a title for the section --> 
            <h6> March 16, 2020 - April 3, 2020 </h6> <!--adds a date to the section -->
            <p>The goal of this project was to create different image manipulation solutions that fulfilled all of our client’s requests, through Repl.it, and present these ideas on a Google Slide Deck. I chose to work with Client #1 who advocated for Environmental Protection and wanted to display images that have a lasting impact on people. My client wanted the solution to have geometric shapes, masking, and a consistent logo on each of the images. To start off the project, I analyzed the starting code that we had and made sure that I understood what each line of code did. While reading the code, I noticed that I wanted to use the PIL.ImageDraw.Draw.polygon(), PIL.ImageDraw.Draw.chord(), and PIL.ImageDraw.Draw.ellipse() methods to create the geometric shapes and logo that my client asked for. I did some research on how to use these methods and did calculations, for the coordinates, to create both of my solutions. Throughout the duration of the project I learned how important it is to fully understand how each line of code affects each other and how helpful it is to search up different methods online if I didn’t understand them. Without understanding each line, it would have been impossible to understand what modifications I needed to make to create the desired result. The most challenging part of the project would definitely have to be learning how to use the masks. At first it was difficult because the mask that I envisioned in my head did not look like the one that I was coding, but when I thought about each layer of the mask in small steps, I was able to figure out the correct order and coordinates of each of the shapes. This project occurred while we were sheltered in place and has taught me how resourceful I am to get the help I need, even if I don’t have my peers and teacher with me physically!</p> <!--adds information to the section -->
