      <h1> Field Trips: </h1> <!--makes a title for the section --> 
        <p> By participating in the Engineering Academy at Dublin High School, I was given so many unique opportunities to go on different field trips. Last year I went on a Cal Maritime Academy/ Sun Power field trip. At Cal Maritime, we got a tour of the campus and we learned how students at the school are prepared differently than others. For example, students at the school are required to spend a semester at sea where they will apply their engineering knowledge to steer the boat and get to a specified location. I thought this was such a unique opportunity that the students have, since they get hands on experience for their future careers. Additionally, we went to Sun Power where we toured their office and learned about the workers' roles. I enjoyed learning about how much power could come from an inexhaustible energy source, the sun, and how environmentally friendly solar panels are. The field trip inspired me to take AP Environmental Science this year, so that I could learn more about our environment. Another field trip that I enjoyed was when we went to Stanford and the Computer Science History Museum. At Stanford, we were given a tour of the campus and we learned about different traditions that students had there. Every student on that campus looked so friendly and the tour definitely made me want to add Stanford to my list of colleges that I want to apply to. At the Computer Science History Museum we learned about all the different types of computers that were made, hundreds of years ago. The computers back then were so huge compared to the ones that we have now! My favorite activity was when we used a hole punching machine to punch each of our names on a punched card so that the computer could read it. I enjoyed learning about how people used to use a piece of paper to contain digital data and now we are able to type different programs so easily on our computers. It’s so crazy to see how fast technology has developed and I am so excited to see what the future can hold.

      <h1> Guest Speakers: </h1> <!--makes a title for the section -->
        <p> Additionally I am so grateful to have met such amazing guest speakers through the Engineering Academy. One of my favorite guest speakers was Maynard Holiday. He talked about the different robots that are being created in order to help companies with difficult tasks. For example, in Chernobyl a reactor exploded and lost control of coolants. Unfortunately, this created lots of radiation in the atmosphere. This caused Maynard Holiday and his company to build a robot to detect when a reaction will occur in the basement. Although creating robots is difficult, it allows tasks to be completed without a human risking their life in a dangerous situation. This guest speaker was the most interesting because he showed us videos of different robots that were created to get his audience’s attention. All the robots inspired me, because it proves how endless the possibilities are with engineering! Another one of my favorite guest speakers was Cesar Nicola. He gave his presentation virtually through Cisco Webex Meetings on April 14, 2020 and talked about Agile Software Development in the real world. These agile methodologies were created in order to break up the project with many smaller increments so that the creators can get to the desired goal successfully. They define the requirements by importance and then they start from completing the most important tasks and then move on to the least important tasks. One agile method is SCRUM which has the objective of achieving high-efficient, self-managed, and cross functional teams. I really liked this guest speaker because he really showed me the importance of planning well before actually working on the project. With more planning, it reduces the amount of time wasted and keeps the team focused on the same goal!

      <h1> Mentors: </h1> <!--makes a title for the section -->
        <p> My favorite part about the Engineering Academy at Dublin High School is the Mentorship program. Through this program, I was able to meet such an amazing mentor, Lauren Ayala. She has taught me so much advice about high school, college, applying to jobs, and life that I will definitely remember. For example, she has told me so many stories of her path towards becoming an Computing Infrastructure Engineer at Sandia National Laboratories. As a junior in high school, I was initially very nervous that I wouldn’t know what exact major I wanted to apply for in college, but Lauren has taught me that it is fine to not know exactly what I want to do in life because there is time to test out different interests and I will end up where I am meant to be. This advice has helped me a lot and made me more relaxed when thinking about future careers that I want to pursue. Additionally, Lauren has helped me realize my own strengths. As we practiced my interviewing skills, reviewed over my resume, and talked about my passions, she has helped me recognize what sets me apart from other people. I have always believed that I was very similar to other people in my grade, but Lauren has pointed out that I am not only very academically inclined but I also am very extroverted and can communicate well with others, which is a very important skill that I never realized I had. Most importantly, Lauren has helped me realize my values in life, like helping others and making the world a better place, which I will definitely take into consideration when picking a career that I would be interested in. The most important lesson that I have learned from my mentor is how crucial it is to do something that makes you happy because that is the main goal in life. I am extremely blessed to be given this opportunity to meet such an amazing person like Lauren Ayala. :)

      <h1> Volunteer/Work Experiences:  </h1> <!--makes a title for the section -->
        <p>Throughout highschool I have had lots of volunteer experience/ work experience. Since sixth grade, I have been an altar server at my church, where I assist the priest during mass, alongside two other altar servers. Being one of the oldest altar servers has taught me how to have leadership skills and guide the younger altar servers to improve. I have also learned team working skills when I work with other altar servers so that we all can divide the roles evenly and help the mass run as smoothly as possible. Additionally, throughout highschool I have created a club called STAR club, which stands for Students Taking Active Roles. As the Vice President of the Club, I am in charge of communicating with different organizations to find volunteer opportunities for our club members. I have contacted an organization called Shoes that Fit where we helped raise money to donate 15 pairs of shoes for students at Fredrickson Elementary. We have also worked with Blessings in a Backpack where we create positive note cards for students who are going through a lot of problems at home. All of these volunteer opportunities have taught me how much community service means to me, as I have a passion for helping people in need. I have also gained work experience through a paid internship, during the summer, at a company called Big Switch. At the internship, I learned how to use raspberry pis to create a dashboard kiosk for hallway monitors at the company building. Additionally, I learned how to use GitHub and BitBucket alongside Markdown and RestructuredText in order to generate documents in HTML and PDF form. Through this internship I was able to work with my peers to explore basic engineering concepts as well as familiarize myself with an office workplace. </p> <!--adds information to the section -->
