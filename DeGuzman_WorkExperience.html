      <h1> Field Trips: </h1> <!--makes a title for the section --> 
        <h5> Cal Maritime/Sun Power </h5> <!--makes a subtitle for the section --> 
          <p> The Cal Maritime Academy and the Sun Power field trip was my favorite field trip that we went on this year. At Cal Maritime, we got a tour of the campus and we learned how students at the school are prepared differently than others. For example, students at the school are required to spend a semester at sea where they will apply their knowledge of steering a boat to get to a specified location. I thought this was such a unique opportunity that the students have, since they get hands on experience for their future careers. In addition, we went to Sun Power where we toured their office and learned about the workers' roles. I enjoyed learning about how much power could come from an inexhaustible energy source, the sun, and how environmentally friendly solar panels are. The field trip inspired me to apply for AP Environmental Science next year, so that I can learn more about our environment. I know how polluted our Earth is and I would like to make my entrepreneurship project on a way to improve the environment. </p> <!--adds information to the section -->

      <h1> Guest Speakers: </h1> <!--makes a title for the section -->
        <h5> Maynard Holiday </h5> <!--makes a subtitle for the section -->
        <p> My favorite guest speaker was when Maynard Holiday came to our class. He talked about the different robots that are being created in order to help companies with difficult tasks. For example, in Chernobyl a reactor exploded and lost control of coolants. Unfortunately, this created lots of radiation in the atmosphere. This caused Maynard Holiday and his company to build a robot to detect when a reaction will occur in the basement. Although creating robots is difficult, it allows tasks to be completed without a human risking their life in a dangerous situation. This guest speaker was the most interesting because he showed us videos of different robots that were created. All the robots inspired me, because it proves how endless the possibilities are with engineering!</p> <!--adds information to the section -->

      <h1> Internships: </h1> <!--makes a title for the section -->
        <h5> Big Switch </h5> <!--makes a subtitle for the section -->
          <p> During the past summer, I had a internship at Big Switch. At the internship, I learned how to use rasberry pis to create a dashboard kiosk for hallway monitors at the company building. Additionally, I learned how to use Git Hub and BitBucket alongisde Markdown and RestructuredTect in order to generate documents in HTML and PDF form. Through this internship I was able to work with my peers to explore basic engineering concepts as well as familiarize myself with an office workplace.</p> <!--adds information to the section -->

      <h1> Volunteering Experiences:  </h1> <!--makes a title for the section -->
        <h5> Altar Serving </h5> <!--makes a subtitle for the section -->
          <p> One of my current favorite volunteering activity is Altar Serving. Every weekend, when I go to chuch, I volunteer to help run the mass. To do this, I am given a list of duties to complete, with other altar servers between 11- 18 years old, to assist the priest. This volunteering experience has taught me to have leadership skills in a group setting in order to successfully complete a task. As a Junior in High School, I am usually the oldest Altar Server, so I have learned how to teach my skills to my younger teammates. I also have learned to be responsible by always completing the tasks that I promise to achieve.  </p> <!--adds information to the section -->
