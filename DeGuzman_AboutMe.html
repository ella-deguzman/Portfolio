            <h1> Who am I? </h1> <!--gives a title for the section--> 
            <p> Everyone has goals that they want to accomplish. During my life, I would love to pursue a job in the biomedical engineering field. My interest in engineering started when my dad would take me to his work whenever I had no school. I always thought it was fascinating how engineering allows people to use their ideas and apply it to technology to increase productivity and benefit users. Even though I was interested in engineering, I thought that I wanted to be a doctor when I was a freshman, so I applied to the Biomed Academy to explore my interest in the biomedical field. Unfortunately I was not accepted, but that did not stop me from applying to the engineering academy for Sophomore year. I was extremely excited when I got accepted and I found a love for engineering through my Principles of Engineering class. From working with a team to coding to creating robots, this class taught me about basic skills needed for different fields of engineering. After sophomore year I decided to join an internship at my dad's work, Big Switch, where I was able to learn how to assemble raspberry pis, use BitBucket, use GitHub, code using Markdown, and much more. All of these experiences led me to become interested in pursuing a job involving engineering because of how applicable it is to a multitude of fields. I am currently looking into the biomedical engineering field because it has a combination of both of my interests: helping people through medicine and problem solving through engineering. To achieve this goal, I intend on being in the engineering academy from sophomore to junior year at Dublin High. I am also taking environmental science to explore my passion for community service and helping the world become a better place for future generations. I aim on getting a Biomedical Engineering Masters degree, at a college, in the future. Having all this background knowledge in engineering could help me become closer to reaching my goal. </p><!--information for the section-->

            <p> There are lots of traits that everyone has that makes them unique. One main trait that I have is that I am a very dedicated person. If I have a goal that I set my mind to, I will dedicate lots of time to do so. For example, one of my goals of Junior year was to make it into the lacrosse team. I played lacrosse my Freshman year but skipped Sophomore year lacrosse due to my hard classes, so I was nervous that I wouldn’t make the team my Junior year. To accomplish this goal, I practiced everyday and I attended every single one of the conditionings. It was a lot of hard work but within a month, I already relearned a lot of the skills. When tryouts came, I felt very prepared and I made it onto the Varsity Lacrosse team! Having lots of dedication can benefit me in a career in engineering, because if I am given goals, I will put in all my work to accomplish it. I am also very optimistic. For instance, last year in my AP European History class, I kept receiving failing grades on all my quizzes. I remember working so hard but getting worse grades than people who didn’t even study for the test. Even though I didn’t receive the grades that I wanted, I decided to keep a positive mindset. Instead of thinking “I can’t do this,” I believed that “this will push me to do harder next time.” I surprisingly improved in test taking and ended the semester with an A in AP Euro! Being optimistic is a trait that can help me with engineering because instead of giving up, I will try my hardest to improve myself. </p> <!--information for the section-->

            <p>One of my major accomplishments was creating my own club with my friends during my sophomore year. We created STAR club for Dublin High, which is a community service club. I wanted to create this club because I have a huge passion for helping others. Every week I am working harder and harder to improve the club and I can't wait to see how the club grows. Another accomplishment was playing four seasons of sports at Dublin High School, Golf and Lacrosse, while maintaining straight As during those seasons. It was very difficult to keep a balance between my AP classes and my sports but I found a way to do both to make myself happy! Through these situations, I learned that I am very committed and I can manage my time well.</p>  <!--information for the section-->

            </p> My experiences have definitely shaped me to become the person I am today and I have learned so much about my interests and abilities. Thank you for taking your time to learn about me. Feel free to explore the rest of my site to see the past projects and accomplishments I have done! </p> <!--information for the section-->
